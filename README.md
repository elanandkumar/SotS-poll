## Before you begin
- Make sure node/npm is installed and configured properly

## Setup
- Checkout the code
- Navigate to the directory
- Start the application by passing `npm start` command

## Wondering why no `npm install`?
Because the node server and REST API is created using only inbuild packages provided by node. *no third party* package are used.

REST API, huh??

> So, which DB is being used?

*Well, no DB*

All operation saves the data into the JSON file on the disk.

## What about front-end then?
Glad that you asked.

This application do have frontend but no framework except following:
- bootstrap css
- jquery as a dependency of bootstrap

**jquery???**
I know, I know. This is in work and jquery will be removed soon.


## What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, checkout the code/app.
